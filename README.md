## README

This project is a refactored version of https://github.com/ns-code/ng18-maintainusers

This version introduces signal usage. This refactoring enables the following benefits:

1. Much simplified Components code
2. A simple state management and
3. Simplified unit testing

This is an Angular-v18 project that illustrates CRUD functionality implementation for a maintain users application. It gets data from a backend REST API server https://github.com/ns-code/ns-maintain-users

### Usage

With the above-mentioned API server running, run 'ng serve' (or 'npx ng run' if you have different version of Angular installed globally). The app can then be accessed using http://localhost:4200
